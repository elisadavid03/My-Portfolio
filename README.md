# My Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Iâ€™m a beginner front-end web developer, learning and growing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This portfolio showcases my journey as I work on building responsive web pages, experimenting with layouts, and enhancing functionality with JavaScript.

### Some things Iâ€™m currently learning include:

- Writing clean and structured HTML
- Styling web pages with modern CSS
- Adding interactivity through JavaScript
  
Iâ€™m excited to continue improving my skills and contributing to projects as I learn. Feel free to explore my work, and thank you for stopping by! ðŸš€
